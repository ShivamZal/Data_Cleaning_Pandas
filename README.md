## Goals
### The sample dataset consists of many holes or inaccuracies which can lead to issues with data integrity and utilizations such as mis-information, null values, repetition, incorrect values and unwanted data.
Therefore, the goal of this coding exercise is to optimize the dataset and removing the errors so that it can be further used for Data Analysis, Visualization and Storage.

## Methods 
### Libraries like pandas and numpy
Cleaning methods consists of:
1. Removing duplicate values
2. Fill Na or null values 
3. Create new insightful columns based on existing
4. Change number formats and textual data for better readability
